The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and comprises approximately 50 million tuples. The project attempted to represent it in a relational database format. The dataset includes detailed information about various attributes of songs on Spotify, including Artists, Genres, Track Length, etc., making it suitable for performing meaningful queries and extracting valuable insights.

Several interesting SQL queries have been developed to extract insights from the relational model. Additionally, indexes have been proposed to optimize query execution performance. Timings for query execution with and without indexes are reported, demonstrating the impact of indexing on query efficiency.
